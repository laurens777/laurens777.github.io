I recently defended my MA thesis titled "Morphosyntactic Variation in the Past Tense of Greek Canadians". I am currently working at SFU as a program assistant while I work towards publishing my MA research. While I take a break from my formal studies I plan to deepen my knowledge of sociolinguistics and register studies through independent study.
